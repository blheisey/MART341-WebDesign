                The book takes place in the middle of a war and starts with a group of school boys who are on a plane being evacuated from Britian. The plane is shot down over a deserted, tropical island. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, use a conch shell to gather the group together. They decide to nominate a boy named Ralph as their leader, who then appoints Jack to be in charge of the hunting group.

               Ralph, Jack, and a boy named Simon decide to explore the island, and later, Ralph says they should light a fire as a signal to passing ships. They use Piggy's glasses to start a fire, but fail to keep an eye on it. As a result, the fire becomes out of control and burns the nearby forest likely killing one of the youngest boys.

                As time passes on the island, many of the boys enjoy the extra freedom. Ralph, however, is more concerned with the signal fire and shelter. The hunters are unsuccessful in catching a wild pig, and Jack's interest with hunting increases.

                One day, a ship passes by the island, but Ralph and Piggy discover the signal fire that the hunters were supposed to be watching has gone out. Ralph and Piggy are very angry at Jack, but Jack and his hunters have just gotten their first kill, and they act very strangely. They reenact the whole thing in a weird performance. When Piggy confronts Jack directly, Jack hits Piggy in the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and attempts to restore order with a speech. At the meeting, some of the younger boys discuss their fear that there may be a monster of some sort hiding on the island, and they think it may be hiding in the ocean.

                Soon after the meeting, there is a battle above the island involving military planes. Someone with a parachute lands on the mountain with the signal fire, dead. The twins, Sam and Eric, who were in charge of the fire, eventually wake up and think the body with the parachute is a monster. They run back to camp to tell the others.

                Several boys led by Jack and Ralph, who still aren't getting along, investigate the "monster", concluding that it's a large ape. At a meeting, Jack pushes for Ralph to be removed from power saying he's a coward. When the others refuse, Jack rallies his hunters and leaves the group. Ralph tells the others to start a new signal fire on the beach, but in the midst of the task, most of them leave to join Jack.

                Jack and his new tribe of hunters perform a violent ritual where they kill a pig and put its head on a stick as an offering to the beast. Simon later comes across the head, which is now surrounded by flies. He has a vison that makes it appear the head is speaking to him. He decides the voice belongs to the "Lord of the Flies". He imagines it saying that Simon can't escape him because he exists wthinin all men. Horrified, Simon faints. After he wakes up, he walks up the mountain discovers the "monster" is a dead body wearing a parachute. He comes to the realization that the real "monster" is inside all of them. When he goes back down to the beach to tell the others, everyone, including Ralph and Piggy, are involved in Jack's crazed feast. When they see Simon, they pounce on him and kill him.

                The next day, Ralph and Piggy try to reason with Jack, but Jack's hunters attach them and steal Piggy's glasses. When Ralph goes to Jack's part of the island to talk, a boy named Roger pushes a boulder down the mountain, killing Piggy and smashing the conch shell. Ralph barely escapes.

                The rest of the night and the next day, Ralph hides while the other boys hunt him. Jack tells the boys to set the forest on fire to force Ralph out of hiding. Ralph remains in the forest and finds and destroys the pig's head. Eventually, he has to emerge on the beach. Waiting for the others to kill him, Ralph falls to the ground with exhaustion. To his surprise, he looks up to see a British naval officer above him. The ship had seen the forest fire. The other boys show up on the beach still looking savage. The office asks Ralph what happened. Ralph begins to cry, and the other boys cry too. The officer looks away so the boys can compose themselves.
