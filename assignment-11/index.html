                    <h1>Early Exploration</h1>
                    <p>The building block of photography is considered to be Aristotle's &quot;camera obscura&quot;. Aristotle first described the &quot;camera obscura&quot; in 4th century BC. It consists of a pinhole that an image is shown through. Any image shown through the pinhole is reversed or upside down. In 1021, the &quot;camera obscura&quot; was invented.

                    Joseph Ni&eacute;pce and Louis Daguerre are considered the inventors of photography. In 1826, Ni&eacute;pce took the world's first photograph. Using a sheet of pewter coated with bitumen, Ni&eacute;pce captured the view from his workroom in Saint-Loup-de-Varennes, France. Louis Daguerre was a painter who was interested in Ni&eacute;pce&apos;s work, so he decided to partner with him. Daguerre worked to decrease the exposure time, which, for Ni&eacute;pce&apos;s picture, was at least 8 hours. Using silve-plated copper sheets and mercury vapor, Daguerre significantly reduced the exposure time. By 1839, the daguerrotype process had reduced the exposure time to a few seconds, and photography was becoming more widely used and accepted.</p>

                    <h1>The Technological Revolution</h1>
                    <p> In 1889, George Eastman invented film rolls and sold it through his company, Kodak. The invention of film rolls allowed multiple pictures to be taken one after the other.

                    In 1925, the first Leica camera was made by Oskar Barnack. The camera used a 35 mm film. Because of its small size, the Leica camera was a lot easier to work with than the previous box cameras.

                    In 1936, color photography became an option. Kodak released Kodachrome, which is a film containing multiple layers for developing in color. Soon after, Polaroid created the first instant camera that could produce a picture shortly after it was taken.

                    <h1>The Digital Age and Beyond</h1>
                    <p>In 1975, Steven Sasson designed the Eastman Kodak camera, which is generally considered the first self-contained digital camera.

                    The first cell phone to have a built-in camera was the J-SH04. It was created by the Sharp corporation in Japan and released in November 2000. The phone had a 0.11-megapixel camera. This innovation was a turning point in mobile technology and eventually led to the use of camera phones worldwide.
