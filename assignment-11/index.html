            <h1 class="paragraph">Early Exploration</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">The building block of photography is considered to be Aristotle's &quot;camera obscura&quot;. Aristotle first described the &quot;camera obscura&quot; in 4th century BC. It consists of a pinhole that an image is shown through. Any image shown through the pinhole is reversed or upside down. In 1021, the &quot;camera obscura&quot; was invented.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Joseph Ni&eacute;pce and Louis Daguerre are considered the inventors of photography. In 1826, Ni&eacute;pce took the world's first photograph. Using a sheet of pewter coated with bitumen, Ni&eacute;pce captured the view from his workroom in Saint-Loup-de-Varennes, France. Louis Daguerre was a painter who was interested in Ni&eacute;pce&apos;s work, so he decided to partner with him. Daguerre worked to decrease the exposure time, which, for Ni&eacute;pce&apos;s picture, was at least 8 hours. Using silve-plated copper sheets and mercury vapor, Daguerre significantly reduced the exposure time. By 1839, the daguerrotype process had reduced the exposure time to a few seconds, and photography was becoming more widely used and accepted.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Soon after that, William Talbot came up with a way for multiple prints to be made from one photograph called the calotype process.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In 1851, Frederick Archer created the collodian wet plate process that produced a negative image on a glass plate. The wet plate process was eventually replaced by the more practical gelatin dry plate process. Before, the wet plates had to coated, exposed, and processes all at one time. Dry plates, however, could be transported, exposed, and processed at a different time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In 1889, George Eastman invented film rolls and sold it through his company, Kodak. The invention of film rolls allowed multiple pictures to be taken one after the other.</p>
