                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Four Walls is an interior design company that specializes in modern, minimalistic design. We believe less is more. Although some may think that means our designs shy away from color, this isn't the case. To us, "less is more" means nothing should be added to a room unless it adds to the overall design. If bright, bold paint colors, art, or furniture will elevate a room, we will happily use them. Otherwise, we'll rely on clean lines and neutral colors to create a sense of balance. 
                </p>
                <p>Our top priority at Four Walls is to design spaces that our customers want to be in. To achieve this, our customers will always be a part of the design process, making each design unique. Therefore, within four walls, there are endless possibilities.</p>
