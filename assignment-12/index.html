                <h1>Loveable Personality</h1>
                <p>Ragdoll cats are named after their docile personality. They are said to melt into the arms of whoever is holding them. They are considered calm, social animals who are very devoted to their owners. Ragdolls are excellent family pets because they get along well with children. Since they sleep during the day, Ragdolls don't mind being left alone for 8-12 hours while their owners are gone, but they will become bored or lonely if left alone for more than 12 hours.</p>

                <h1>Beautiful Coloring</h1>
                <p>There are 24 different colors/patterns Ragdoll cats can be. All variations of Ragdoll kittens are born white, and they get darker with age. Older Ragdolls will continue to darken even once they're mature. Ragdolls have something called the Himalyan gene. Cats with this gene develop pointed coats. Pointed coats mean the cat's fur is mostly pale, but there are points like the ears, face, tail, and legs that are darker. This is because the Himalayan gene prevents melanin production at body temperature. So, the cat's body remains pale. Since, the body temperature drops around the ears, face, tail, and legs, melanin is produced there, and the Ragdoll's coat becomes pointed. Fun fact: Ragdolls living in warmer places will often be a few shades lighter than ragdolls living in cooler places.</p>

                <h1>Playful</h1>
                <p>Ragdolls are very playful, especially as kittens. They enjoy toys and climbing structures and love playing games with their owners. Like all cats, Ragdolls are nocturnal, so they are most active at night. This means they might wake up their owner by patting them on the face or meowing loudly to get them to play. The Ragdoll's playfulness means it doesn't mind getting dressed up or hugged, so they get along well with kids.</p>
